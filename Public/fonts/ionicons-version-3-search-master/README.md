# Ionicons Version 3.0 Search

Dynamically search for version 3.0 Ionicons using icon names, tags, and community-added tags to better locate the icon you need! **View the live page [here](https://infinitered.github.io/ionicons-version-3-search/)** and get your search on!

Clicking on an icon provides convenience text for classname, full HTML tag, escaped HTML, and CSS content. It also shows the icon in various font sizes.

Think an icon needs another tag? Is the version 2.0 name not finding the new 3.0 tag you want? See below for how to contribute!

## What is Ionicons?

[Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) by [Drifty](https://github.com/driftyco) is the premium icon font for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), but can be used in any project. It is completely free and open source under an MIT license. The original repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/driftyco/ionicons/), and switch to branch 3.0 to see version 3.0.

If you're using version 2.0, you can search for icons on the [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) site.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to the community tags are welcome. Add tags to the `communityTags` array for the associated icon in **scripts/icons.js**. Verify the changes are non-breaking - use a JSON linter and run the app locally to test.

To run the site locally, you will need to run a small server. If you have Ruby installed, you can run this tiny server from your command line:
```
$ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 3000
```

Then go to localhost:3000 to view it.
